- [ ] don t use dash
- [ ] make 2 commands server and forecast
    - same docker container
    - server mode serves up data
    - forecaster gets stuff. use a k8s job on a cron schedule
    - look into using spf13/cobra for command (use the cobra-cli to make a template repo and then copy your crap in)

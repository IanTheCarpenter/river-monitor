Overview:
-- River schema: an object that contains a list of sites that correspond to real life data collection sites. These objects are in a mongodb table. They shouldn't change often
-- A forecast builder will iterate through the river schemas and build a forecast object based on the data provided. For now, the predictions will only be based on whether or not the river is on a rise upstream of the given site.
-- Users can select segments of the river to be alerted if they are on a rise

Input on how to organize project
- all packages in monorepo? Or many repos? How to share types?

Forecaster- Goroutine vs Container?

Better way to ingest diverse api data, process into uniform format?
